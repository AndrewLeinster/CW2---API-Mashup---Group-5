        <p>Successful toy salesman Scott Calvin prepares to spend Christmas Eve with his son Charlie. Scott wants
            Charlie to maintain his belief in Santa Claus, despite not believing himself. Scott's former wife, Laura,
            and her psychiatrist husband Dr. Neil Miller, both stopped believing in Santa at a young age and feel that
            Charlie needs to do so as well (after an older kid made Charlie upset by saying Santa is not real).

            On Christmas Eve Scott burns the turkey he was cooking, so he and Charlie go to Denny's for dinner. The two
            share an uneventful evening and go to sleep. They are awakened by a noise on the roof. Scott startles a man
            wearing a Santa suit standing on the roof, who slips and falls to the ground. The man's body vanishes,
            leaving behind a red suit and business card that states: "If something should happen to me, put on my suit.
            The reindeer will know what to do." Scott and Charlie find a sleigh and reindeer still on the roof. At
            Charlie's request, Scott dons the suit and spends the rest of the night delivering gifts before the reindeer
            take them to the North Pole. Bernard the head elf explains that, by putting on the suit, Scott is subject to
            a legal technicality known as "The Santa Clause", and has accepted all of Santa's duties and
            responsibilities. Bernard gives Scott eleven months to get his affairs in order before reporting back to the
            North Pole on Thanksgiving. Confused and overwhelmed, Scott changes into the pajamas provided to him and
            falls asleep.

            Awakening in his own bed, Scott thinks it was all a dream (though he is confused that he is wearing the
            North Pole pajamas). Laura, Neil, and the school staff are concerned when Charlie proudly tells his school
            class that Scott is Santa. Not wanting to destroy Charlie's newfound enthusiasm, Scott asks him to keep
            their North Pole trip a secret. Over the course of the year, strange things begin to happen to Scott. His
            hair turns white and a beard constantly re-grows, even immediately after shaving. He develops an increased
            fondness for sweets, primarily milk and cookies. He gains an inordinate amount of weight seemingly
            overnight. During a meeting with his company, Scott becomes angry at a proposal to advertise a toy military
            tank by showing Santa riding it. He also begins to recount 'naughty' and 'nice' children by name when he
            sees them. After Laura and Neil witness children wanting to sit on Scott's lap at Charlie's soccer game,
            they assume Scott is deliberately misleading Charlie and decide to have a judge suspend Scott's visitation
            rights. At Thanksgiving, a desperate Scott goes to Laura and Neil's house to see to Charlie but Neil will
            not let him anywhere near Charlie. When Neil insists that Scott is not Santa, Charlie shows Scott a magical
            snow globe that Bernard had given him, finally convincing Scott that he really is Santa. When Laura and Neil
            allow Scott a minute to talk to Charlie alone, Bernard appears and transports him and Charlie to the North
            Pole. Thinking Scott has kidnapped Charlie, Laura and Neil call the police.

            On Christmas Eve, Scott sets out to deliver gifts with Charlie in tow. Upon arriving at Laura and Neil's
            home, Scott is arrested inside the house while Charlie waits for him in the sleigh. The elves send a team to
            break him out of jail. Scott returns Charlie to his house and insists he spend Christmas Eve with Laura and
            Neil. His heartfelt speech to Charlie about the importance of everyone in the family convinces Laura and
            Neil that he is Santa. Laura burns the court papers suspending Scott's visitation rights, and tells Scott he
            can visit anytime. Bernard appears and tells Charlie that any time he shakes his magical snow globe his
            father will appear. Before leaving, Scott gives Laura and Neil the two Christmas presents that they never
            got as children, which had caused their disbelief in Santa.

            Charlie summons Scott back with the snow globe and Laura agrees to let Charlie go with Scott in the sleigh
            to finish delivering the presents.</p>

        <h1 class="tosHeading">Other Terms and Conditions</h1>

        <p>Eight years have passed since Scott Calvin took on the mantle of Santa Claus. Head Elf Bernard and Curtis,
            the Keeper of the Handbook of Christmas, inform Scott that there is another clause â€” the "Mrs. Clause".
            Scott is now pressed to get married before the next Christmas Eve or the clause will be broken and he will
            stop being Santa forever. At the same time, Abby the Elf delivers even more distressing news: Scott's
            teenage son Charlie is on the naughty list, due to having vandalized his school to get attention. Scott must
            return to his home to search for a wife and set things right with Charlie. He brings this up when visited by
            the Council of Legendary Figures, consisting of Mother Nature, Father Time, Cupid, the Easter Bunny, the
            Tooth Fairy, and the Sandman. To cover for Santa's prolonged absence, Curtis helps Scott create a life-sized
            animatronic Santa clone, much to Bernard's horror. However, at Santa's request, Bernard reluctantly plays
            along, and tells the other elves that Santa had a makeover, so they will not question the double's synthetic
            appearance.

            Because of the impending end of his contract, Scott undergoes a "de-Santafication process" that gradually
            turns him back into Scott Calvin. He has a limited amount of magic to help him. Scott returns home to his
            former wife Laura, her husband Neil, their six-year-old daughter Lucy, and Charlie. He and Charlie face the
            ire of school principal Carol Newman when Charlie defaces the lockers.

            At the North Pole, Toy Santa follows the rulebook too literally and begins to think that everyone in the
            world is naughty because of their small mistakes. As a result, Toy Santa takes over the North Pole using
            giant toy soldiers he made himself and unveils his plan to the elves to give lumps of coal to the world.
            Bernard exposes Toy Santa as a fraud, and Toy Santa places him under house arrest.

            After a few failed dates, Scott finds himself falling for Carol. He accompanies her in a horse-drawn sleigh
            to the faculty Christmas party, during which she confesses she used to believe in Santa as a child, until
            she was forced to stop doing so by her parents after fighting with children who told her Santa was not real.
            Using a little of his Christmas magic, Scott enlivens the otherwise dull party by presenting everyone with
            their childhood dream gifts. He makes a special presentation to Carol, and, with his last remnant of magic,
            wins her over and they kiss under mistletoe. However, when Scott attempts to explain to her that he is
            Santa, she believes that he is mocking her childhood, and throws him out. Later, Charlie is upset about
            Scott dating his principal and he confesses how hard it is for him that Scott is never around like other
            fathers, and reveals the pressure he is under to conceal the secret that his father is Santa. Lucy manages
            to convince Charlie not to be mad at him, which leads Charlie to convince Carol that Scott is Santa by
            showing her the magic snow globe he received during Scott's initial transformation.

            Curtis flies in to tell Scott about Toy Santa's plan. However, Scott has used up the last of his magic
            wooing Carol, and cannot return to the North Pole. With help from the Tooth Fairy, Scott and Curtis manage
            to get back, only for Toy Santa to find them and tie them up. Charlie and Carol spring them free by
            summoning the Tooth Fairy to fly them to the North Pole. Scott goes after Toy Santa, who has already left
            with the sleigh, riding Chet, a rambunctious reindeer-in-training, and they both crash back into the
            village. With an army of elves, Carol, Bernard, Charlie, and Curtis lead them into a snowball fight to
            overthrow the toy soldiers. Toy Santa is defeated and reduced to a six-inch height, Scott marries Carol in a
            ceremony, Scott transforms back into Santa and Carol transforms into Mrs. Claus, and Christmas proceeds as
            it always has. Scott and Charlie reveal the truth to Lucy about Scott being Santa Claus, promising to keep
            his secret.</p>

        <p>Twelve years have passed since Scott Calvin took on the mantle of Santa Claus and married Carol Newman, who
            is now a teacher in the North Pole. On Christmas Eve, she tells a group of young elves a story from her
            life with Scott while expecting their first child. Scott invites his in-laws, Sylvia and Bud Newman, to the
            North Pole, along with Scott's ex-wife Laura, her husband Neil, their daughter Lucy, and Scott's son
            Charlie. Meanwhile, he is summoned to a meeting of the Council of Legendary Figures, consisting of Mother
            Nature, Father Time, the Easter Bunny, Cupid, the Tooth Fairy, and the Sandman, concerning the behavior of
            Jack Frost, who is jealous that he has no holiday or special occasion in his honor. Because he has been
            promoting himself during the Christmas season, Mother Nature suggests sanctions against him. As Scott is
            attempting to get the in-laws to come without revealing that he is Santa, Jack Frost negotiates a light
            sentence of community service at the North Pole, helping Scott and the elves put up various Canadian-themed
            paraphernalia, as Carol's parents believe Scott is a toymaker in Canada; Scott consents.

            However, Frost's ultimate goal is to trick Santa into renouncing his position. When now Head elf Curtis
            inadvertently reveals the "Escape Clause", Frost sneaks into The Hall of Snow Globes and steals Scott's one
            containing Scott as Santa. If Scott holds the globe and wishes to have "never been Santa at all," he will go
            back in time and undo his career as Santa. When Lucy discovers this, Frost freezes her parents and locks her
            in a closet. He then orchestrates situations that make Scott think he must resign to make things better.

            Frost tricks Scott into invoking the Escape Clause and both are sent to Scott's front yard in 1994, when
            Scott caused the original Santa to fall off his roof and had to replace him. Frost causes the original Santa
            to fall off the roof and grabs Santa's coat before Scott can. Scott is sent to an alternate 2006, where he
            has been CEO of his old company for the last twelve years and business takes priority over family. Scott
            also learns that Laura and Neil divorced and Carol moved away years ago.

            Scott goes to find Lucy and Neil, who are vacationing at the North Pole, which Frost has turned into a theme
            park. Christmas is now "Frostmas", the elves are miserable, the reindeer are confined to a petting zoo, and
            parents can pay for their kids to be placed on the nice list. Scott finds Lucy and questions Neil about
            Laura; he states that Scott's workaholic absence in Charlie's life put all the pressure on Neil, and Charlie
            didn't want him to be his father, causing the divorce between him and Laura.

            Scott confronts Frost and causes a distraction and convinces Lucy to steal Frost's snow globe for him. Lucy
            throws the snow globe to Scott, but Frost catches it. Scott plays a recording of Frost saying "I wish I'd
            never been Santa at all" from a novelty North Pole pen Frost gave him earlier, invoking the Escape Clause,
            sending both Scott and Frost back to 1994. Scott restrains Jack long enough to let his 1994 counterpart get
            the coat, making him Santa Claus again, sending both back to the present in the original timeline.

            Scott reconciles with his family and Jack is arrested by elf police. He reveals he cannot unfreeze his
            victims unless he unfreezes himself, something he says he'll never do. Scott convinces Lucy via a snow globe
            he had given her earlier of her warmly hugging a snowman, to give Frost a "magic hug" to unfreeze and reform
            him. It works, Laura and Neil unfreeze and Frost becomes a new person. The "Canada" ruse is dropped and
            Scott appears as Santa to Carol's parents. With two hours remaining before Santa must leave for his
            Christmas deliveries, Carol goes into labor.

            Months later, while Carol is telling the tale to her students, Scott walks in to reveal their son, Buddy
            Claus.</p>
